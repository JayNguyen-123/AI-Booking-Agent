# AI-Booking-Agent
This project demonstrates how to leverage LangGraph for building a smart travel assistant that uses multiple language models (LLMs) to handle tasks such as finding flights, booking hotels, and sending personalized emails. The agent is designed to interact with users, invoke necessary tools, and provide a seamless travel planning experience.
